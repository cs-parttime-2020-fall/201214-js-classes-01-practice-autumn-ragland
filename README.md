## Movies
Declare a `Movie` class with properties name, rating, and year released. Set the value of this properties for each instance in the constructor.

The `Movie` class will also have three methods : `outputMovie`, `changeRating` and `changeYearReleased`. The `outputMovie` method will output all movie properties in a formatted string
```
The movie [MOVIE] came out in [YEAR] and has a rating of [RATING]
```
The `changeRating` method will accept a new rating an update the rating property of a Movie object.
The `changeYearReleased` method will accept a new year released and update the year released property of a Movie object.

Create two instances of the movie class with different property values. Call the `outputMovie` method on both movies.

Update the rating and the year released of one or both movies using the correct class methods. Output updates movie(s) properties using the correct class method to ensure the update class methods worked.
